        The house is based on 4 basic principles. <br>
        <mark>The linear growth, the anchoring of horizontal and vertical elements, the parallel movement of the 2 central volumes and
    finally their bridging. According to these principles but also taking into account the
    country where the house is theoretically located, a fifth principle emerges. That of the
    relationship of the building with nature, which, although not analyzed separately, is felt
    through the previous ones.</mark> <br>
    The video seeks to make these principles known as seen on both story boards.
