        The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of
        a large hen's egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm
        (1.8–2.2 in) in diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin
        and bright green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible
        seeds. The fruit has a soft texture, with a sweet and unique flavor.
