<p class="h1-title">
    Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the
    edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.
</p>

<p>
    The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of
    a large hen's egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm
    (1.8–2.2 in) in diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin
    and bright green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible
    seeds. The fruit has a soft texture, with a sweet and unique flavor.
